Task: You are given pairs of videos. The first video is the original, and the second video contains added elements such as objects or people. Your task is to generate a detailed prompt describing the added elements. Focus on the changes between the two videos, and describe the new objects or characters added to the scene, including their appearance, position, actions, and how they interact with the environment.

Steps:
1. Compare the two videos to identify the differences.
2. Describe the new objects, characters, or changes introduced in the second video compared to the first one.
3. Include details about the added elements such as:
   - Appearance (color, size, shape, distinguishing features).
   - Position (location within the frame, proximity to other objects).
   - Actions (movements, interactions with the environment or other characters).
4. Format your description as a prompt suitable for video editing, emphasizing the editing details.

Example:
- **Original Video**: A scene of a park with people walking and a fountain in the center.
- **Edited Video**: The same scene with a dog running across the frame and a person sitting on the bench.
- **Generated Prompt**: "Add a small brown dog running from the left side of the screen to the right, in front of the fountain. Add a person with a blue jacket sitting on the bench to the right of the fountain, facing forward."

Original Video: A beach scene with waves gently hitting the shore and a few people walking in the distance.

Edited Video: The same beach scene, but now there is a kite flying in the sky and a child running along the shore holding the kite string.

Generated Prompt: "Add a colorful kite flying high in the sky, moving gently with the wind. Add a child wearing a red shirt running along the shore, holding the kite string."
